# Mustache Templates for MSBuild and .NET Project

This repository provides a NuGet package that you can reference in your .NET project which allows you to render Mustache template when the project is built.

For a general tutorial on Mustache template, see: <https://www.tsmean.com/articles/mustache/the-ultimate-mustache-tutorial/>

**Note:** Due to the way MSBuild works, any file generated for the first time during build is only picked up on the second MSBuild run. Normally, this is not a problem because the files generated by this package are supposed to be check in under version control.

**Note:** Due to the way Visual Studio works, updating the version of this NuGet package while Visual Studio is running will *not* result in the new version being used. The (simplified) reason is that Visual Studio can load the assembly of this package only once - but can't unload it afterwards (to then load the new version). For the new version to be used, you have to restart Visual Studio.
